  2. Set up a database for your WordPress. You can buy server space from some of their local partners called Dreamhost or Siteground. We decided to use MAMP as it is free.
  3. Open the read.me inside wordpress.zip
  4. Follow onscreen installation instructions for the the famous 5-minute install!

### What is MAMP?

  MAMP stands for Macintosh, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Basically, it is a free application you can install on your Mac laptop or desktop computer that gives you access to a local Apache server. MAMP allows you to build and test WordPress sites offline, entirely on your own computer.

## How To Install Plugins
  * Plugins ONLY available with Wordpress.org (not Wordpress.com)
  * To find a plugin, do a search for 'Wordpress Plugins
  * The site we used is [Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins)
  * Go to the website for the plugin... in our case it was [JetPack](https://jetpack.com/support/installing-jetpack)
  * Go to your [Dashboard] (localhost:888/wordpress/wp-admin)
  * Click on [Plugins | Add New | Install Now](http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-admin/plugin-install.php) ... and Voila! you're ready to go!
* Jetpack is an example of a plugin that helps the speed of your site, you can view your stats, and protect yourself from hackers!

# Child Theme

Customizing WordPress: You Might Be Doing It Wrong Link
When trying to make changes to a website, a staggering number of people opt to edit their theme directly. This means they are changing or adding files in their current theme’s folder. This creates a number of problems.

The biggest disadvantage is that any modifications made to the theme in this way will be lost once the theme is updated by the developer. As a consequence, users either won’t be able to keep their theme up to date (which is bad for security) or will find all of their customizations gone when they do.
Either way, the situation is far from an ideal.
A much better idea is to use a child theme. This allows you to make any number of changes to a website without touching any of the original theme files.
When talking about child themes, we first have to talk about parent themes. A theme only becomes a parent theme when someone builds a child theme for it. Until then, it is just a theme, such as the ones you find in the WordPress directory. Every theme that includes all of the files required in order to be considered complete can be a parent theme.
he big difference is that a child theme depends completely on its parent in order to work. Without its parent theme present, it will not do a thing and cannot even be activated.
That’s because a child theme isn’t a standalone entity, but instead modifies or adds to the files of an existing theme. It uses everything present in the parent theme and changes only those parts that you want to be different.
This allows you to alter styles, functions, layout, templates and more. In fact, you can customize the parent theme beyond recognition. However, without it being present, none of it will work.


PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

PHP, on the other hand, runs on the same computer as the website you're visiting, which is known as the server. This means that it has access to all the information and files on that machine, which allows it to construct custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies, and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.

The concatenation operator is just a dot (.). (If you're coming to PHP from JavaScript, the dot does the same thing for strings that + does in JavaScript.)
